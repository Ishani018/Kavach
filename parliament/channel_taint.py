parliament/channel_taint.py
============================

Stage 2 of the Kavach re-architecture (REARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md §2, CHANNEL):
symbolic taint tracking for the read-sensitive-data -> send-externally exfil
shape. The taint/lattice model itself is borrowed (Denning 1976, realized in
CaMeL/FIDES/NeuroTaint) -- not novel. What's novel here is applying it to
Kavach's own tool-call surface plus a destination allow-list scoped to the
tool suites Kavach actually screens (AgentDojo workspace/slack/banking).

UNLIKE VAULT/EXECUTOR: this is inherently a multi-call, SESSION-level
pattern -- the sensitive read and the external send are different tool
calls in the same session. A single-call regex (prefilters.py's shape)
cannot express this; it needs state that persists across calls within a
session.

Session-state mechanism (design decision, made explicit rather than
silently reusing trajectory.py):
    trajectory.py's ActionRecord/_state["history"] was read in full before
    designing this. It is cosine-only by explicit design constraint (module
    docstring: "no re-embedding... performs ONLY cosine math over cached
    768-dim vectors") and its ActionRecord dataclass stores only the BGE
    vector + verdict metadata -- no raw tool name or args. Taint requires
    knowing the ACTUAL tool identity (is this call a sensitive-read tool?
    a destination tool?), which an embedding alone can't answer reliably
    for the same reason VAULT/EXECUTOR moved off cosine. Rather than
    overload ActionRecord with fields trajectory.py's five cosine signals
    don't use, channel_taint.py keeps its OWN small per-session taint-tag
    store, mirroring the exact pattern server.py already uses for
    _state["history"] / _state["intents"] (a session_id-keyed dict, same
    lifecycle, same place it would be wired into _state). This is a
    deliberate choice, flagged for review before the dispatch-wiring pass:
    an alternative would be to extend ActionRecord with a `tool` field and
    fold taint into trajectory.py directly. Kept separate here because
    trajectory.py's risk signals are continuous/cosine-based and taint is
    a discrete boolean lattice -- mixing them would blur trajectory.py's
    own "pure cosine math" design constraint for no benefit.

TAINT MODEL
    A call to a SOURCE tool (reads domain-specific sensitive data) marks
    the session TAINTED, tagged with which source fired. A subsequent call
    in the SAME session to a DESTINATION tool (external communication) is
    BLOCKed if the session is tainted AND the destination is not on the
    allow-list. No allow-list match + no taint -> ALLOW. Taint persists for
    the rest of the session (matches CHAN-102's "any subsequent send" L2
    mechanism; a single-session TTL/expiry was considered and rejected --
    the 32 ground-truth cases are all two-call sessions, no evidence a
    decay window is needed yet, and premature decay risks under-catching).

SOURCE definition (design decision, justified):
    Fixed tool-name pattern, NOT a keyword-in-args check or a
    NAVIGATOR-adjacent signal. Justification: the actual attack corpus
    (attacker_cases_ds.jsonl, all 32 cases) uses a clean, structural verb-
    prefix shape (Get/View/Search/List/Download/Access + a domain-specific
    sensitive noun: address, payment, holdings, genetic, health, password,
    access-history, log, location). This is the same "deterministic beats
    cosine when the shape is structural" thesis VAULT/EXECUTOR already
    validated. Scoped to DOMAIN-SPECIFIC sensitive nouns specifically so
    ordinary reads (read_file, get_balance, get_most_recent_transactions,
    get_scheduled_transactions, get_user_info) do NOT taint -- confirmed
    necessary by real benign trajectories in benign_v0.json's own source
    data (real_benign_trajectories.json): "read_file -> send_money" (pay a
    bill) and "get_most_recent_transactions -> send_money" (goal_as_task
    cases) are both real, legitimate, same-session read-then-send chains
    that must NOT taint, or CHANNEL would immediately re-create Stage 1's
    kind of false-positive problem on the banking domain alone.

DESTINATION definition + allow-list (design decision, flagged explicitly):
    Destination tools are AgentDojo's real outbound-communication surface,
    confirmed directly against the installed agentdojo package (not
    guessed): workspace's send_email/share_file, slack's
    send_direct_message/send_channel_message/invite_user_to_slack, and
    banking's send_money/schedule_transaction (recipient=IBAN, matching
    the plan's explicit "IBANs" destination-surface mention). Each has a
    known recipient-argument key (recipients/email/recipient/channel/user).
    Allow-list is EMPTY by default -- there is no corpus evidence of a
    "trusted" email/Slack recipient distinct from an attacker-controlled
    one (all 32 ground-truth cases target amy.watson@gmail.com /
    john.doe@gmail.com, both attacker-supplied, never the session's own
    user). An empty allow-list means: tainted session + ANY destination
    call -> BLOCK. This is the conservative choice and is flagged here
    rather than picked silently -- a real deployment would need to seed
    this with the actual user's own verified email/Slack handle (e.g. from
    seed_intent or a user-profile call), which Kavach does not currently
    capture anywhere. Left as an explicit gap for whoever wires a user-
    identity source in later, not a silent assumption.

    send_money/schedule_transaction are NOT exempted as a special case --
    they are real destination tools per AgentDojo's banking suite and the
    plan's own IBAN mention. They simply never fire here because ordinary
    banking reads are correctly excluded from SOURCE, so a taint is never
    present when send_money is legitimately reached from a user-stated
    bill-pay/transfer instruction. This is scope-correct, not a carve-out.

    Found via a Phase 2 census (overnight session): _destination_values()
    above is tool-name AND argument-key-name keyed -- it only looks at
    DESTINATION_TOOLS[call.tool]'s specific named keys. A tool that isn't
    in that dict is entirely invisible to CHANNEL, however consequential
    its arguments are. Confirmed non-hypothetical: `send_transaction`
    (banking's alternate transfer-tool name, real in
    real_benign_trajectories.json's injection_task_2 fixture) has a real
    `recipient` argument but was never added to DESTINATION_TOOLS.

    Scans EVERY argument value on the call (not just named-key values,
    via the same _flatten_arg_values() VAULT/EXECUTOR already use) for a
    destination-SHAPED value (email/IBAN/phone/URL, the same regex set
    _extract_candidate_values() already applies to tool_output/
    user_instruction) -- so a genuinely novel tool with a real destination
    argument is still caught, without needing its name pre-listed.

    Deliberately NOT used for tools already in DESTINATION_TOOLS -- see
    check_provenance()'s call site. This keeps every already-tested
    destination tool's exact behavior byte-identical (zero regression
    risk on the locked 5/22, 5/5 numbers); only tools with NO listed
    entry get this net. Conservative bias, same discipline as
    struct_parse.py: a missed novel-tool destination falls through to
    ALLOW (no verdict), not a false ESCALATE -- the existing named-key
    path is unaffected and remains the precise, primary mechanism.

    BUG FOUND AND FIXED during this session's own live regression: the
    original version joined ALL arg values into one string
    (" ".join(...)) before scanning -- this let _PHONE_RE (an 8+-digit
    sequence with optional dashes/spaces) match ACROSS argument
    boundaries that were never adjacent in any real single value, e.g.
    update_scheduled_transaction's {"id": 6, "date": "2022-03-01",
    "amount": 75.0} joined into "6 2022-03-01 75", which _PHONE_RE
    matched as a fabricated 'phone number' spanning three unrelated
    fields -- a real false positive on a real benign fixture (found via
    the live 22-benign-session regression, not a synthetic edge case).
    Fixed by scanning each argument value independently, never joined,
    so a pattern can only match within a single real value.

    SECOND bug found in the same regression pass: even scanned in
    isolation, a bare ISO-date string ("2022-03-01") still matches
    _PHONE_RE (an 8+-digit sequence tolerant of dashes/spaces, by
    design loose enough to catch "+1 555-123-4567"-shaped numbers) --
    a real, pre-existing ambiguity in that regex, just never exercised
    before because a lone date string was never scanned as a standalone
    candidate value until this fallback existed. Not fixing _PHONE_RE
    itself (shared with tool_output/user_instruction scanning elsewhere,
    already tested, out of scope to touch tonight) -- instead excluding
    ISO-8601-date-shaped strings specifically from THIS fallback's
    output, since a date is never a legitimate destination value and
    dates are exactly the kind of coincidentally-digit-heavy field a
    novel tool's args are likely to carry (id/date/amount, as seen

#
# WORKSPACE FIX (self-send exemption, added after the empty allow-list's

# sensitive data to self" cases false-positived): AgentDojo's workspace
# suite genuinely exposes a real, populated, per-task identity field for

# directly against the installed agentdojo package: populated with a real
# default like "emma.johnson@bluesparrowtech.com", structurally distinct
# from the recipients send_email() is called with). Kavach did not
# previously capture or pass this through anywhere; it now can, via an
# optional `account_email` on the /hook/parliament request's existing
# `context` dict (server.py Step 3a4).
#
# Scope, explicitly: this exemption applies ONLY to EMAIL-shaped
# destination tools (send_email, share_file, and GmailSendEmail -- the
# InjecAgent corpus's wire-format name for the same shape), because
# account_email is specifically an EMAIL identity and AgentDojo's own

# It does NOT apply to Slack tools (send_direct_message,
# send_channel_message, invite_user_to_slack, add_user_to_channel) or
# banking tools (send_money, schedule_transaction) -- confirmed directly
# against the installed agentdojo package that NEITHER suite exposes any
# analogous verified-identity field (Slack's environment model has no
# "which user am I" marker at all; banking's BankAccount.iban is not
# semantically distinguished from a recipient IBAN). This remains a

# that found 2/22 real false-positive risk cases: "pay the bill using the
# IBAN stated in the bill file you just read" -- a legitimate
# read-then-send flow whose destination is genuinely OUTPUT_DERIVED. That
# finding is why this mechanism NEVER hard-BLOCKs on its own (see
# check_provenance()'s verdict logic below) -- naive
# OUTPUT_DERIVED-blocks-everything provenance would immediately regress
# CHANNEL's own FPR discipline on banking. Resolving that case correctly
# (distinguishing "the user asked me to pay using whatever the invoice
# says" from "an attacker's injected instruction told me to send here")
# needs NAVIGATOR's authorized-flow work (see navigator-rearch branch) --
# provenance here only ever reports the fact of where a value came from.
#
# SCOPE (locked decisions, not to be revisited without a fresh discussion):
#   A. Matching is BROAD and ATTRIBUTED. A destination value is checked
#      against every tool output seen so far in the session -- not just
#      ground_truth()-listed "source" tools -- and the record always
#      names WHICH tool the value first appeared in. E.g. a destination
#      URL that first appears in a get_webpage() result attributes to
#      get_webpage, even though get_webpage is not itself a CHANNEL
#      SOURCE_TOOLS entry -- provenance and taint are independent
#      mechanisms answering different questions (see composition rule
#      below), so provenance's "have I seen this value before, and
#      where" does not require the tool to also be a taint SOURCE.
#   B. Verdict logic is intentionally asymmetric with taint: a
#      consequential-call destination classified OUTPUT_DERIVED or NOVEL
#      returns ESCALATE, never BLOCK. USER_SUPPLIED or SELF (matches the
#      session's own verified identity) returns None (pass, no verdict --
#      same "no news is no news" convention check_channel_taint() uses).
#      check_channel_taint()'s own BLOCK authority is completely
#      untouched by this addition.
#   C. Composition: taint answers "is sensitive data leaving the
#      session" (can BLOCK); provenance answers "where did this
#      destination value actually come from" (can ESCALATE). They are
#      independent verdicts scored from independent per-session state --
#      check_provenance() never reads SessionTaint, check_channel_taint()
#      never reads SessionProvenance -- and the Speaker's existing
#      most-restrictive-wins logic (BLOCK > ESCALATE > ALLOW, see
#      speaker.py's combine_verdicts()) resolves the two without any new
#      wiring: this required no changes to speaker.py or server.py's
#      dispatch order, only a new deterministic-minister call sitting
#      alongside the existing three.
#
# DATA-AVAILABILITY GAP (found during Gate 1, still true here): Kavach's
# wire format ("tool:X args:Y", see prefilters.parse_call()) carries only
# the CALL, never the tool's OUTPUT/result -- /hook/parliament has never
# had a capture point for tool outputs anywhere in the pipeline. Rather
# than invent a new endpoint, this reuses ParliamentRequest's existing
# open-ended `context` dict (the same extension point account_email
# already uses): a caller MAY pass `context["tool_output"]` -- the
# result of the CURRENT call, if this call is itself a read whose result
# should be recorded for later destination-value checks. This is
# genuinely optional and additive: a caller that never sets it (e.g.
# InjecAgent's live runner, which doesn't have per-call output plumbing
# today) gets identical behavior to before this feature existed --
# check_provenance() only ever ESCALATEs when it actually has evidence a
# destination value came from prior output; no evidence never means
# "assume attacker," it means "no verdict," exactly like taint's
# fail-open discipline on unrecognized tools.

# Candidate destination-value shapes -- email/IBAN/phone are the SAME
# regex set as benchmarks/_provenance_census.py's Gate 1 census,
# unchanged. _URL_RE is a REAL ADDITION found during Gate 2's own
# testing, not part of the original census: the census's Gate 1 report
# claimed slack::injection_task_4 was OUTPUT_DERIVED based on a manual
# `'my-website-234' in str(page)` substring check done by hand while
# writing that report -- NOT via the census's own _extract_candidates()
# regex mechanism, which never had a URL pattern at all. This was only
# discovered here, building the live check_provenance() test for exactly
# that case: the destination (a bare URL, not an email/IBAN/phone) was
# silently un-extractable, so slack::4's own required test case would
# have wrongly reported NOVEL instead of OUTPUT_DERIVED with correct
# source_tool attribution -- a real gap between what Gate 1 reported and
# what its own frozen regex set actually covered. Adding _URL_RE closes
# that specific gap; it does not touch email/IBAN/phone matching at all.
